This **INTERMEDIATE** course is designed for individuals comfortable
using _R_, and with some familiarity with _Bioconductor_. It consists
of approximately equal parts lecture and practical sessions addressing
use of _Bioconductor_ software for analysis and comprehension of
high-throughput sequence and related data. Specific topics include use
of central Bioconductor classes (e.g., _GRanges_,
_SummarizedExperiment_), RNASeq gene differential expression, ChIP-seq
and methylation work flows, approaches to management and integrative
analysis of diverse high-throughput data types, and strategies for
working with large data. Participants are required to bring a laptop
with wireless internet access and a modern version of the Chrome or
Safari web browser.

Schedule (tentative)
--------------------

Day 1 (9:00 - 12:30; 1:30 - 5:00)

- Working with Genomic Ranges and other _Bioconductor_ data structures
  (e.g., in the
  [GenomicRanges](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/GenomicRanges.html)
  package).
- RNA-Seq known gene differential expression with
  [DESeq2](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/DESeq2.html) and
  [edgeR](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/edgeR.html).
- Gene set enrichment, machine learning, and other approaches to
  understanding patterns of differential expression.

Day 2 (9:00 - 12:30; 1:30 - 5:00)

- ChIP-seq and regulatory work flows with
  [csaw](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/csaw.html)
  and
  [minfi](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/minfi.html).
- Integrative data analysis -- emerging approaches
- Working with large data -- efficient, parallel, and cloud
  programming with
  [BiocParallel](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/BiocParallel.html),
  [GenomicFiles](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/GenomicFiles.html),
  and other resources.
